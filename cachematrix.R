## These functions calculate the inverse of a given matrix and
## store the invoice for later retrival.
##
## When an inverse is requested a second or subsequent time the functions will
## return the cached value thereby saving computation time.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
